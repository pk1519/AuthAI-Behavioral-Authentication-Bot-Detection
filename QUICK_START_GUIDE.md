Full system integration demonstration with detailed output

## 📊 Key Features

### 🤖 Behavior Simulator Modes
- **Basic**: Simple variability for initial testing
- **Intermediate**: Moderate complexity with realistic patterns  
- **High**: Maximum variability for stress testing
- **Dataset Replay**: Uses real behavioral data with controlled noise

### 👥 User Profiles
- **Casual User**: Average speed, moderate accuracy (200 chars/min)
- **Fast Typer**: High speed, lower accuracy (480 chars/min)
- **Careful User**: Slow speed, high accuracy (140 chars/min)
- **Mobile Style**: Slow speed, touch-like patterns (100 chars/min)

### 📈 Analytics Dashboard
- Real-time detection statistics
- Model performance comparison
- Historical trend analysis
- Simulation effectiveness tracking
- Actionable recommendations

## 🔍 Generated Log Files
After running tests, you'll find:
- `behavior_simulation_log.json` - Detailed simulation sessions
- `*_log.csv` - Detection event logs
- `demo_analysis_report.json` - Analytics summary

## 🛡️ Safety Features
- All simulated behavior clearly labeled as "SIMULATED"
- Comprehensive logging for audit trails
- Ethical design focused on system improvement, not evasion
- Clear separation between real user data and test data

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. **Test Your Detection System**: Use different profiles to evaluate robustness
2. **Analyze Results**: Review analytics to identify improvement areas
3. **Iterate & Improve**: Use insights to enhance detection accuracy
4. **Monitor Performance**: Track system health over time

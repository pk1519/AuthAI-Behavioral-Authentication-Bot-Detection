## 📋 Usage Examples

### Basic Simulation
```python
from enhanced_behavior_simulator import create_behavior_simulator

# Create simulator with intermediate variability and fast typer profile
simulator = create_behavior_simulator('intermediate_variability', 'fast_typer')

# Set up detection feedback
def detection_callback(is_detected, detection_data):
    print(f"Detection: {'BOT' if is_detected else 'HUMAN'}")

simulator.set_detection_callback(detection_callback)

# Run 30-second simulation
simulator.run_simulation(duration=30.0)
```

### Analytics Integration
```python
from detection_feedback_system import create_detection_feedback_system

# Initialize feedback system
feedback = create_detection_feedback_system()

# Process detection event
detection_data = {
    'user_id': 'test_user',
    'score': 0.75,
    'is_improper': 1,
    'model': 'RandomForest'
    # ... other features
}

feedback.process_detection(
    detection_data, 
    source_type='simulation',
    simulation_profile='casual_user',
    simulation_mode='basic_variability'
)

# Generate analytics
dashboard_data = feedback.generate_performance_dashboard()
```

## 🛡️ Detection Alert System

When the system detects bot-like behavior, it displays:

```
⚠️ BOT DETECTED! ⚠️
